# MintInterview
A unique solution to a tech interview question posed at a Mentors in Tech workshop

This workshop was particularly helpful, not just because they showed the right way to approach a technical interview but specifically because they showed the wrong way first
First he just started coding, the longer the silence, the more my nervous giggles became outright laugh out louds!
Then when the interveiwer went to ask him about his choices, he no idea why he chose what he chose. The interviewer essentially had to ask HIM the clarifying questions he should have asked at the beginning.
His first mistake (one I have made) was to jump right into the code without asking about edge cases or even to clarify the parameters. (A string: just letters or any character? What about white space? etc)
Then he coded without talking through what he was doing/thinking. Not knowing how to answer basic questions about his logic made it look like he was just copying.

Then they started over. This time, he wasn't perfect, but he did the things he was supposed to do. He clarified the parameters, he added some test cases to check when finished.
Once he started coding, he created a new method for the code outside of main, which was also a cleaner approach.
